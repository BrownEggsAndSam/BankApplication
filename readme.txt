Executive Presentation: DSET Enablement Tool
1. Background
The Dataset (DSET) Enablement Tool is a Collibra workflow designed to streamline Attribute Rationalization.

Attribute IDs uniquely represent business concepts, while Physical Names are field-level names that vary across datasets (e.g., Loan Identifier → LN_ID, LN_FC_ID, LN_ALT_ID).

Without automation, mapping Physical Names to the correct Attribute IDs requires time-consuming, manual review against the Enterprise Data Glossary (EDG) and registered datasets.

This tool was built to:

Reduce effort

Increase accuracy

Standardize data registration

Accelerate dataset onboarding

2. Purpose
Provide users a guided, automated way to populate Attribute IDs for datasets being onboarded into Collibra.

Leverage existing registered datasets and the Enterprise Data Glossary to:

Validate user-entered Attribute IDs.

Suggest matches based on proven mappings.

Flag operational or invalid entries for review.

3. Problem Statement
Current challenge:

Business and technical teams spend excessive time manually searching for Attribute IDs when registering datasets.

Risk of inconsistent mappings if teams use outdated or incorrect IDs.

Manual rationalization is error-prone and slows down data onboarding.

Impact:

Inconsistent metadata.

Delays in dataset registration.

Reduced trust in metadata quality.

4. Goal
Automate and simplify Attribute Rationalization so users can:

Confidently register datasets with accurate Attribute IDs.

Reduce turnaround time for dataset onboarding.

Improve metadata consistency across the enterprise.

5. Demo Outline — Business Features to Show
A. Input Stage
Upload DSET Template

Show the two tabs: Dataset Information (ignored) and Attribute Information (used for matching).

Highlight typical user input (Physical Names filled in, Attribute IDs blank or partially filled).

B. Matching & Validation
Automatic Physical Name Matching

Explain that matching is exact, case-insensitive, whitespace normalized.

Show how:

Single exact match → Attribute ID auto-filled (green).

Multiple matches → Logged in “Attribute Log” for review.

No matches → Left blank + “No recommendations” in log.

Validation of Existing IDs

Green = valid (found in accepted EDG).

Red = invalid (not in accepted EDG).

Orange = operational attribute (ATTR08105).

C. Attribute Log
Reviewing Suggestions

Show the “Attribute Log” tab with:

Physical Name

Suggested Attribute IDs

Attribute Names

Source Dataset

Status (“Multiple matches”, “No recommendations”, “Conflict with user-provided ID”)

Explain how this helps resolve ambiguity quickly.

D. Speed & Accuracy
Execution Speed

Run the tool live to demonstrate processing hundreds of rows in seconds using preloaded caches.

Accuracy Gains

Show before/after example where the tool:

Corrected invalid IDs.

Auto-filled blank IDs.

Flagged operational attributes.

E. Business Impact
Efficiency

Quantify reduction in manual effort (e.g., “1 hour of work reduced to <5 minutes”).

Consistency

Show how centralizing EDG & dataset registry lookups ensures uniform attribute usage.

6. Key Talking Points for Executives
Why it matters: Cuts down onboarding time, reduces errors, and increases trust in metadata.

Low learning curve: Business users can use it without deep technical knowledge.

Scalable: Handles large datasets efficiently.

Future-ready: Can expand to fuzzy matching, synonym support, and attribute relationship mapping.

If you’d like, I can also make you a one-slide visual showing the workflow from User Upload → Cache Lookup → Matching & Coloring → Output & Review, which would make the presentation more executive-friendly.

Executive Presentation: DSET Enablement Tool
1. Background
The Dataset (DSET) Enablement Tool is a Collibra workflow that streamlines Attribute Rationalization during dataset onboarding.

Attribute IDs uniquely identify business concepts; Physical Names are field-level names that vary widely across systems.

Without automation, mapping Physical Names to the correct Attribute IDs is manual, slow, and error-prone.

2. Purpose
Automate Attribute ID population and validation for new datasets using existing registered datasets and the Enterprise Data Glossary (EDG).

Provide users with clear matches, validations, and recommendations to improve speed and consistency in metadata registration.

3. Problem Statement
Manual Attribute Rationalization:

Time-consuming: Users manually search EDG and datasets for matches.

Inconsistent: Different teams may use outdated or incorrect IDs.

Error-prone: Increases the risk of duplicate or invalid mappings.

Impact:

Delays in onboarding datasets.

Reduced trust in metadata accuracy.

4. Goal
Reduce onboarding time, improve accuracy, and increase metadata consistency by:

Automatically filling known Attribute IDs.

Validating user-provided IDs.

Logging ambiguous or operational attributes for quick review.

5. How It Works (High-Level Backend Overview)
Uses final approved domains in Collibra:

Cloud EDL Dataset Registry & Data Dictionary → source for Physical Name → Attribute ID mappings.

Enterprise Data Glossary (EDG) → validates Attribute IDs (only accepted/active terms).

Matches are exact, case-insensitive, whitespace-normalized for predictability.

Color coding highlights:

Green = valid match

Red = invalid Attribute ID

Orange = operational attribute (ATTR08105)

Ambiguities and conflicts go to an Attribute Log for user action.

6. Demo Outline — Business Features
Upload DSET Template (focus on Attribute Information tab).

Automatic Matching & Validation:

Auto-fill single matches.

Validate existing IDs.

Flag operational and invalid entries.

Attribute Log Review:

Multiple matches.

Conflicts with user-provided IDs.

No recommendations.

Efficiency Gains:

Show before/after of manual vs. automated process.

Highlight time savings and accuracy improvements.

7. Business Impact
Efficiency: Cut onboarding time from hours to minutes.

Consistency: Ensures the same Physical Name maps to the same approved Attribute ID enterprise-wide.

Quality: Prevents invalid, outdated, or inconsistent mappings from entering production.


 Attribute Matching Logic

User ID present?

In EDG → ✅ Green

Not in EDG → ❌ Red

No User ID → Match Physical Name in Cloud EDL:

1 match → Auto-fill, ✅ Green

>1 matches → Log options, no fill

0 matches → Log “No recommendations”

Operational?

Maps to ATTR08105 → 🟧 Orange flag

Conflicts → Keep user ID, log suggestions
