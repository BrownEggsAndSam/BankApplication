Current Limitations
Exact Match Only: Wonâ€™t suggest similar names or aliases (e.g., LN-ID vs LN_ID).

Punctuation Sensitivity: Matches fail if punctuation differs.

Dependent on Existing Data Quality: Suggestions only as good as the data already in EDG and Cloud EDL.

No Real-Time Governance Check: Doesnâ€™t automatically enforce policy complianceâ€”curators still review.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements
Fuzzy Matching & Synonym Support: Match similar names and handle punctuation/abbreviations.

Attribute Relationship Mapping: Suggest related attributes, not just direct matches.

Domain/Segment Filtering: Narrow search to relevant business areas for more precise suggestions.

Inline Review Actions: Allow users to resolve conflicts and accept suggestions directly in the workflow.

Usage Analytics: Track how often suggestions are accepted/rejected to improve matching logic.
